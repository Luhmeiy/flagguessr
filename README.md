## 📑 About

FlagGuessr is a feature-rich flag guessing game born from the need for a more customizable experience.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project was born from a deep desire for a more customizable flag guessing game. I played many web flag guessing games, but all of them felt lacking. Some had a functionality that I liked, but a bad design. Others had great designs, but lacked functionalities. My idea was to bring into this project the best of both worlds.

This was my first attempt at a fully-fledged Next.js webapp and my second significant experience with MongoDB. Even though it was simpler than some of my other projects, since it doesn't have the whole register/login necessities, it was still an interesting challenge to get everything up and running.

Through building FlagGuessr, I gained a better grasp of Next.js' App Router and server components. Although I'm still far way from being good at it, I now have a better understanding of data modeling in MongoDB and how to properly use Mongoose to fetch data.
